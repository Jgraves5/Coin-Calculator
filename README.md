# Coin-Calculator

## Intro ##
This is a coin calculator program which asks the user for a quantity of money, entered as a floating-point number, and then computes how many dollar coins, half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies (in that order!) would be needed to add up to this quantity.
